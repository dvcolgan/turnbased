    <h1>Rules of Land Grab</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Land Grab, a massively multiplayer online board game (MMOBG).</p>
    <p>The goal of Land Grab is to grab land.  Players place units on tiles to claim them, but other players can fight you by placing their own units on your tiles.</p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>To play Land Grab, you must first create an account.  We will ask for the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Username and password - used to log in</li>
        <li>Email - optional, if you set it, we will email you an activity summary every day</li>
        <li>A team color - all of your units will use this color, as well as tiles you own</li>
        <li>A leader name - be creative and make up a title for yourself</li>
        <li>A people name - similarly, make up a name for the people in your empire</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Choosing an initial settlement</h2>
    <p>After this you will be taken to the game board.  In order to begin playing, you need to set up a home base.  You can use the arrow icons to move around the board and find a good spot.  <strong>Your initial encampment must be at least 4 tiles away from other players' territory.</p>
